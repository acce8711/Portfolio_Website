                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>This project was completed as a group project for a sensor interactions class. 
                    The task was to build an alternative controller using Arduino and develop a game 
                    for it in OpenFrameworks. We came up with a space game featuring two wearable 
                    controllers strapped onto players' thighs. The controllers determine the speed 
                    and angle of the spaceship inside the game. They also contain physical feedback 
                    such as LEDs and vibration motors. The game itself is an endless 2D runner style 
                    game where the player collects stars and avoids rocks.

                <h2>A controller with a simple mechanic</h2>
                <p>At the start, brainstorming ideas was a bit tricky, so we checked out other alternative controllers
                     for inspiration. What stood out to us was that the ones we liked had a simple, satisfying
                      mechanic resembling a real-world action. We decided to build our controller around this
                       concept especially considering our limited time frame.</p>   
            </div>

            <div class="info">
                <div class="stage"> <p>IDEATE</p> </div>
                <h2>Visualising the concept</h2>
                <p>We decided to centre our controller around a single mechanic: <strong>moving a lever forward and backward</strong>. 
                    This choice is all about immersing players in the game, giving them 
                    that machinery feel as if they're actually controlling a spaceship.  
                    We also added in <strong>button pressing</strong> for launching projectiles at rocks. 
                    I then created some <strong>sketches</strong> to better visualise our ideas. </p>

                <h2>Would the idea actually work?</h2>
                <p>We were a bit worried about the practicality of wearable controllers, 
                    thinking they might move around too much while players operated the levers. 
                    To put our concerns to the test, I made a simple prototype using some cardboard 
                    and other household items to test out the movement of the controller. 
                    We had several users try it on and move the lever. To our relief, 
                    the movement worked smoothly, and the controller stayed put on the players' 
                    thighs.</p>

                <h2>1. Building the controller</h2>
                <p>We started off with building the controller by setting up the wiring for the
                     Arduino and enclosing it in a cardboard box. We used two IR sensors, two LEDâ€™s, 
                     and two vibration motors. We also connected the Arduino to Firmata in 
                     OpenFrameworks to test the sensors and filter out any noise. </p>

                <h2>2. Programming the game</h2>
                <p>As we were building the controller, we also programmed the game at the same time.  
                    We programmed the basic movement of the spaceship, projectile shooting, and star collection.</p>
            
                <h2>3. Connecting the controller to the game</h2>
                <p>Once the controller was done, it was time to connect it to the game.
                     We implemented the Firmata code that we used for testing the controller with the game code.</p>

                    <div class="takeaways">
                        <p><strong>Wiring is painful. </strong> The main challenge I faced 
                            in building the controller was with the wiring. With multiple 
                            sensors and components, there were a bunch of wires involved.
                            Occasionally, the wires would come undone, especially when the 
                            controller was moved. 
                            </p>
                        <p><strong>It was nice implementing haptic feedback.</strong> My favourite part 
                            about the controller was implementing the haptic feedback through vibration. 
                            It was fun to come up with ways of how we could immerse the players in our game. </p>
                        <p><strong>Inspired to explore more Arduino.</strong> I really enjoyed exploring how the 
                            physical world can be connected to the virtual world. It was also nice to see what 
                            can be done with Arduino. Iâ€™m now inspired to tackle Arduino projects in my personal 
                            time!</p>

                    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                    <p><strong>Go wireless.</strong>
                        Since I struggled a bit with wires with this project, I've decided that for 
                        future projects involving movement and numerous components, I want to try wireless 
                        solutions. Exploring things like PCB layouts and other wireless options seems more 
                        efficient and less tangled up.
