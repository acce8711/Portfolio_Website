                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>Overview
                    My teammate and I designed and developed Study Space over a span of four weeks during
                     the summer of 2023. Our goal was to create a user-friendly dashboard web study 
                     application that keeps students on track and motivated. The app offers progress 
                     tracking and a range of useful features, including a Pomodoro timer, a to-do list
                      with CRUD functionality, and an AI-powered chatbot.</p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>One significant challenge commonly encountered by students while studying is staying productive. 
                    This issue can arise from digital distractions and the tendency to procrastinate, leading to poor
                     academic performance.</p>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>A web-based productivity tool designed with students in mind. This all-in-one solution incorporates 
                    essential features, including a Pomodoro timer, to-do list, chatbot, and progress tracker, all aimed at enhancing focus and motivation during study sessions. </p>

                <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
                <p>Secondary research was conducted and four main insights were gained:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="listedText">
                    <p>1. A <strong>pomodoro technique</strong> and clear goals help avoid procrastination.</p>
                    <p>2. Individuals are more likely to successfully stick to a habit when the task is planned and <strong>progress is recorded.</strong></p>
                    <p>3. <strong>80%</strong> of user viewing time on a website is spent <strong>above</strong> the scrolling fold.</p>
                    <p>4. The more tabs an individual has open, the harder it it to for them to stay focused and productive.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="info">
                <div class="stage"> <p>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</p> </div>
                <h2>Lack of features that help avoid digital distractions</h2>
                <p>After examining five most popular Pomodoro and studying web apps,
                     a common issue arose. The web apps often either fixated solely 
                     on the Pomodoro timer, or if they did incorporate additional 
                     features, they contained excessive information that may be 
                     distracting for the student.  Additionally, most of them didn't 
                     effectively address digital distractions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info">
                <div class="stage"> <p>DESIGN</p> </div>
                <h2>Insights → Design Opportunities</h2>
                <p>After looking over the insights from the research done, the following design opportunities were focused on:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="listedText">
                    <p>1. Allow users to track their progress to further motivate them.</p>
                    <p>2. Provide salient information clearly and immediately.</p>
                    <p>3. Provide users with a search bar alternative to prevent them from opening new tabs. </p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="info">
                <div class="stage"> <p>WIREFRAMES</p> </div>
                <h2>Exploring the Layout</h2>
                <p>Wireframes were created for desktop view to explore the layout. A dashboard
                     layout was used to prevent the need for scrolling and give the user instant
                      access to important information. The progress and study tools were split 
                      into two pages to prevent overwhelming the user with too much information.</p>

                <div class="stage"> <p>DEVELOPMENT </p> </div>
                <h2>Planning ahead</h2>
                <p>Before beginning development, a react family tree diagram was 
                    created to plan a comprehensible structure of the app. Even 
                    though we made some tweaks to the diagram as we went along, 
                    it served as a handy roadmap for the essential components 
                    during the initial development stages.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <div class="stage"> <p>ITERATION</p></div>
                <h2>Layout Improvements</h2>
                <p>1. Previously, The chat layout would expand in height, causing the chat prompt text box to float downward, making it invisible to the user unless they scrolled down. To address this issue, the chat box was repositioned to the top, the order of the messages was reversed, and the user’s question was placed as header above the reply.</p>
                <img src="images/studySpace/studySpace_iteration.png" alt="">
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>2. A <strong>new mobile layout</strong> was introduced, utilising a tab layout since the dashboard layout from the desktop would require scrolling to view all of the features. Wireframes were created to explore the new layout, and were implemented during development.</p>

                    <div class="takeaways">
                        <p><strong>Iterated a bunch!</strong> Most of the iterations occurred during the development stage which pointed
                             out the importance of testing and iterating in the early design stages when it’s
                              more manageable to address issues.</p>
                        <p><strong>Became familiar with the OpenAI API.</strong> In this project, I had my first experience working with 
                            the OpenAI API. I learned how to integrate it into the web app and ensure the API key remained secure during 
                            deployment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Built my first complex React web app!</strong> Incorporating numerous features into the study web app offered various chances to create React components and explore their relationships within their family tree of components.</p>

                    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                    <p><strong>Conduct user testing. </strong>
                        The next crucial step is to perform user testing with students. This will reveal potential issues with our study web app and measures  
                        its effectiveness in enhancing productivity. 
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Implement a database.</strong>
                        Currently, all user data is located in localStorage. By introducing a database, users will be able to access their progress from different devices.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Gamify the web app.</strong>
                        To further motivate the student, the web app could be gamified with the inclusion of progress points that allow users to unlock different layouts.
