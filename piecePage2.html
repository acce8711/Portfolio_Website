                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>I did this project as a passion project over a span of 4 weeks 
                    during Summer 2022. The purpose of the project was to develop a 
                    cleaning app that would help individuals build cleaning habits 
                    and to further develop my UX / UI skills.</p>
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>A major problem many individuals face with cleaning their house is 
                    building a habit out of it , lacking motivation,  and letting all 
                    of their chores pile up, resulting in the need for marathon cleaning. </p>
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>An app that utilises <strong>timed cleaning, progress recording</strong> and <strong>gamification</strong>,
                    where users are able to reward themselves for consistently accomplishing 
                    their cleaning tasks. </p>

                <p>I followed the design thinking process to better understand the problem and the challenges 
                    users may be facing. My process was not linear and I revisited the stages throughout the process.</p>

                <p>I conducted secondary research and discovered several insights: </p>

                <div class="listedText">
                    <p>1. Individuals avoid cleaning because of the lack of time.</p>
                    <p>2. Individuals like to admire their work after cleaning and feel satisfied. </p>
                    <p>3. Individuals are more likely to successfully stick to a habit when the task is planned and progress is recorded.</p>

                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                <p>I conducted several interviews to better understand my users and what discourages / motivates them. </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Interview Questions:</strong></p>
                <br>
                <div class="listedText">
                    <p>1. Tell me about the last time that you successfully built a habit. How did you motivate yourself,
                         and what difficulties did you face?</p>
                    <p>2. How often do you clean?</p>
                    <p>3. What motivates you to start cleaning</p>
                    <p>4. When do you prefer to clean and why?</p>
                    <p>5. Tell me about the last time you cleaned, how did you feel before, during and after?</p>
                    <p>6. Tell me about the last time you tried to make a habit of cleaning regularly? What were your
                         motivations? What difficulties did you face?</p>
                </div>


                <h2>Data clustering in Figma</h2>
                <p>To better help me organise the data from the interviews and identify major themes
                     I created an affinity map in Figma.</p>

                    <p>1. Individuals prefer daily light cleaning over marathon cleaning.</p>

                    <p>3. Individuals are more likely to achieve habits when there is a reward.</p>
                    <p>4. Individuals are more likely to stick to a habit when they get breaks.</p>

                    the user to complete the task. I also created a prototype out of the wireframes for the users to
                     use in the testing stage.</p>

                    <div class="takeaways">
                        <p><strong>Focused on data collection/organisation techniques.</strong> Using affinity mapping to organise the
                             data from the interviews helped me greatly in connecting the data and recognizing major themes. I found 
                             it to be a great tool that I will definitely be using in future projects.</p>
                        <p><strong>Became familiar with Figma prototyping.</strong> This was my first time prototyping in figma. It was 
                            definitely a challenge to learn but I found it to be a great tool to use when testing the app and collecting
                             user feedback.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Project Management.</strong>Since this was a solo project solely dedicated to expanding my portfolio 
                            and developing my UI / UX skills I found it was very important to create a clear schedule for myself to keep 
                            myself on track. </p>

                        I did not get a chance to collect any feedback on the final mockups. This would definitely be my next 
                        step as new improvements and the visual design that is present in the mockups creates a whole different
                         experience for the user and is very important to test.
